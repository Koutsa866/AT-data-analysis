# Data Needs to Improve Athletic Training Analytics

## ✅ **CRITICAL** (Need These to Make Better Predictions)

### 1. Historical Injury Records
- **Past 2-3 years of injury data** (any format you have)
- **Include serious injuries** (surgeries, fractures, long recoveries)
- **Actual return dates** (to improve recovery time predictions, if they were recorded)


### 2. Basic Athlete Information  
- **Sport and position** (from team rosters)
- **Age, height, weight** (standard athlete data)
- **Previous injury history** (you already track this)

*Why: Different sports/positions have different injury and recovery patterns*

### 3. Training Context
- **Practice vs. game injuries** (simple classification)
- **Season timing** (pre-season, in-season, off-season)
- **Playing time** (exposure differences)

*Why: Helps predict when injuries are most likely*

## 🎯 **HELPFUL** (If You Have Access)

### 4. Athlete Wearable Data
- **Heart rate/GPS data/ Training load metrics** (weekly mileage, Force Plate Readings, HR Data)

*Why: Early warning signs of overtraining/fatigue*

### 5. Coach Observations
- **Training intensity levels** (1-10 scale per week)
- **Athlete fatigue notes** ("looked tired in practice")
- **Environmental factors** (hot weather, poor field conditions)

*Why: Context for why injuries happened*

The goal of this model will be a simple tool for Players, Trainers, and Coaches to use to make informed predictions and decisons regarding players safely returning from injury.
